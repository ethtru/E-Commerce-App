# E-Commerce-App

A back-end application that employs a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Approach

First, a schema is created within the mysql shell to create the database. Once created, the database was seeded with the provided data for categories, products, and tags. Once seeded, that application can be started using 'npm start'. Fields and rules were implemented for all models based on provided data. Once models were completed, routes were established for all models in the api folder. These endpoints are now able to be tested using Insomnia.
